          Light your nation has it's Inception back in the year 2020, where the
          idea to bring together and mentor young people was birthed. The
          training focused on harnessing the power of the mind to dignifying the
          lives of the young men. Then, weekly meetings on mentorship and
          quarterly football outreaches were held and to date over 2500 men have
          been impacted. Recently (2023), as a foundation we adopted other
          community empowerment pillars such advocacy against drug abuse and
          widows adoption to enhance our ambitions to transforming the whole
          community. To date we have adopted 15 widows families whom we
          regularly supply with food items and other households amenities.
